The discomfort occurs both at rest and with minimal exertion, lasting five to ten minutes each episode, and is accompanied by mild dyspnea on exertion but no diaphoresis or syncope. He denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He lives with his spouse in a two-bedroom apartment and commutes via public transportation. On exam, his blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, SpO₂ 98% on room air, and temperature 36.8 °C. He appears in mild distress but is alert; cardiovascular exam shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops, lungs are clear bilaterally, abdomen is soft and non-tender, and neurologic exam is non-focal. His medications include lisinopril 20 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg nightly. The plan is to rule out acute coronary syndrome with ECG and serial troponins, administer aspirin 325 mg PO now and nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL PRN, continue home medications, monitor vitals and pain every four hours, and consult cardiology for further evaluation.'  \n",

       "'\\n    Your are a NLP expert assistant. You will be provided with a prompt which consists of three sections: \"Input information\", \"Instructions\" and \"Clinical note\".\\n\\n    ## Section 1: Input information\\n    You will be provided with the following information:\\n    1. An arbitrary text sample (CLINICAL_NOTE). The sample is delimited with triple backticks.\\n    2. List of categories that we want to search in the text.\\n    3. The definition that help you guide to identify the specific label for each category.\\n    4. Examples of text samples and their assigned categories. The examples are delimited with triple backticks. These examples are to be used as training data.\\n\\n    ## Section 2: Instructions (follow the steps in order)\\n    1. Analyse the text (CLINICAL_NOTE) and determine whether any of the following six SDOH are explicitly stated based on the definitions labels.  \\n    2. For each SDOH, select exactly one label from the bracketed list.  \\n       • If the note contains none of the listed concepts for that SDOH, choose “unknown”.  \\n       • Do NOT invent new labels, combine labels, or add explanations.\\n    3. Return your answer only as a JSON object with six keys (one per SDOH), and the chosen label.\\n\\n    ### List of SDOH categories and their definitions:\\n    * EMPLOYMENT: labels = [employed, unemployed, underemployed, disability, retired, student, unknown]\\n        The attribute unknown means the CLINICAL_NOTE does not mention information regarding the current employment status of the patient at the time of <<text>>.\\n        The attribute employed means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently employed.\\n        The attribute unemployed means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently unemployed, e.g., out of work, jobless, laid-off, etc.\\n        The attribute underemployed means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently underemployed, e.g., low-paying job, part-time worker etc.\\n        The attribute disability means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently not working due to a disability, e.g., unable to work because of a physical or mental health condition, receiving disability benefits, or described as disabled or incapacitated.\\n        The attribute retired means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently retired, e.g., inactive, retired person, pensioner, etc.\\n        The attribute student means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently a student, e.g. goes to college/university, graduate/undergraduate student, etc.\\n\\n    * HOUSING: labels = [financial_status, undomiciled, other, unknown]\\n        The attribute financial_status means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient\\'s housing situation is affected by their financial status, e.g., unable to pay rent, facing eviction due to financial hardship, etc.\\n        The attribute undomiciled means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is currently without a fixed dwelling, e.g., homeless, living in a shelter, etc.\\n        The attribute other means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient\\'s housing situation does not clearly fall under the categories of financial status or undomiciled, but still provides information about housing, e.g., living in transitional housing, incarceration, or other arrangements not otherwise specified, etc.\\n        The attribute unknown means the CLINICAL_NOTE does not mention information regarding the patient\\'s housing situation.\\n\\n    * TRANSPORTATION: labels = [distance, resources, other, unknown]\\n        The attribute distance means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient has transportation difficulties specifically related to long travel distances, e.g., the clinic is far from home, requires extended travel time, or is located in a different city or rural area with limited access, etc.\\n        The attribute resources means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient has transportation difficulties related to limited access to transportation resources, e.g., lack of a personal vehicle, inability to afford public transit, missed appointments due to transportation issues, or reliance on others for transportation, etc.\\n        The attribute other means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient has transportation difficulties related to other factors.\\n        The attribute unknown means the CLINICAL_NOTE does not mention information regarding the patient\\'s transportation situation.\\n\\n    * PARENTAL: labels = [yes, no, unknown]\\n        The attribute yes means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient has a child under 18 years old.\\n        The attribute no means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient does not have a child under 18 years old.\\n        The attribute unknown means the CLINICAL_NOTE does not mention information regarding the patient\\'s parental status.\\n\\n    * RELATIONSHIP: labels = [single, married, divorced, widowed, partnered, unknown]\\n        The attribute single means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is single.\\n        The attribute married means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is married.\\n        The attribute divorced means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is divorced.\\n        The attribute widowed means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is widowed.\\n        The attribute partnered means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient is partnered.\\n        The attribute unknown means the CLINICAL_NOTE does not mention information regarding the patient\\'s relationship status.\\n\\n    * SOCIAL: labels = [presence, absence, unknown]\\n        The attribute presence means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient has informal or emotional support from family members, friends, or romantic partners.\\n        The attribute absence means the CLINICAL_NOTE states that the patient does not have informal or emotional support from family members, friends, or romantic partners.\\n        The attribute unknown means the CLINICAL_NOTE does not mention information regarding the patient\\'s informal or emotional support.\\n\\n    OUTPUT TEMPLATE (use exactly this format)\\n\\n      \"EMPLOYMENT\": \"…\",\\n      \"HOUSING\": \"…\",\\n      \"TRANSPORTATION\": \"…\", \\n

The traditional vaccine is made from a dead or weakened virus or bacteria, which can stimulate the body to produce antibodies. The mRNA vaccine is made from a small piece of genetic material (mRNA) that is made in the laboratory. This mRNA is a copy of the genetic material of the virus that causes COVID-19. When the mRNA enters the body, it is taken up by cells, which then produce a protein based on the genetic information contained in the mRNA. This protein is a piece of the “spike” protein found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. The body recognizes this protein as foreign and makes antibodies to it. These antibodies are specifically designed to attach to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19, which helps the body’s immune system to destroy the virus.'}]"

This may include advocacy for patient rights, assessment and intervention to address social, emotional, or financial needs, counseling or therapy, case management such as coordinating services and connecting the patient to housing, insurance, or transportation resources, and facilitating access to community-based programs.

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also \\ndiscussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter \\nplaced because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged \\nto home with hospice on ___.\\n\\n# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient \\npresented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed \\nwith tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis \\non ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies \\non the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant \\nimprovement in her pain.\\n \\n# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that \\nshe had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. \\nAfter treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x \\n2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been \\npersistently elevated in the past and should continue to be \\nmonitored.\\n\\n# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient\\'s mental status was A+Ox3 \\non admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n==============\\n\\n# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic \\nhyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia \\nrelated to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis \\ndysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic \\nthrough her hospitalization. Because she was also started on \\n10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she \\nwill require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.\\n\\n# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were \\ncontinued in-house and at discharge.  \\n\\n# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture\\n[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)\\n[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have \\nbiweekly BMPs (script written).
